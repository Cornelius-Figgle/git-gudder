# Server

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/git-gudder/badge/?version=latest)](https://git-gudder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

## Contents

```{toctree}

terraria-server
minecraft-server
```

## Generic Rules I Guess

- don't steal stuff/damage anything
- read the Documentation (this website)
- Remember: the problem is not the server, It is your connection
- No exceptions
- Be excellent to each other
